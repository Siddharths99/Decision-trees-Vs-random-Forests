# Decision-trees-Vs-random-Forests
This project compares the performance of Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers on a heart disease dataset. It includes data cleaning, model training, visualization of the decision tree, feature importance analysis, and cross-validation for reliable performance evaluation.
